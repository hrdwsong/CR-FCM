# Collapse-Resistant Learning Approach Incorporating Multi-Level Features for Few-Shot Classification
Official PyTorch implementation of the paper **Collapse-Resistant Learning Approach Incorporating Multi-Level Features for Few-Shot Classification**.

## Requirements
Python 3.8, Pytorch 1.7.0, timm 0.3.2

## Datasets
Please download mini-imagenet via [link](https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/105646) and put it in ./datasets/mini/.

Please download tiered-imagenet via [link](https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/201309) and put it in ./datasets/tiered/.

Please follow [download_cifar_fs.sh](https://github.com/mrkshllr/FewTURE/blob/main/datasets/download_cifar_fs.sh) to obtain the CIFAR-FS dataset and put it in ./datasets/cifarfs/.

Please follow [download_fc100.sh](https://github.com/mrkshllr/FewTURE/blob/main/datasets/download_fc100.sh) to obtain the FC100 dataset and put it in ./datasets/fc100/.


## Pretraining 
Please follow https://github.com/mrkshllr/FewTURE/tree/main to pretrain the backbone ViT-small and put it in ./initialization/miniimagenet.

## Training and inference
Please see ./run.bat.

## Quick start :fire:
- Please refer to https://github.com/mrkshllr/FewTURE/tree/main to download the checkpoint of the corresponding pretrained ViT-small model.

- Put them in the corresponding folders.

- Run ./run.bat in conda prompt.

## Acknowledgement
This repository is built using components of the [FewTURE](https://github.com/mrkshllr/FewTURE) repository for pretraining and the [CPEA](https://github.com/FushengHao/CPEA) repository for training and inference.

The metric module used in this repository is built upon [DeepBDC](https://github.com/Fei-Long121/DeepBDC)
